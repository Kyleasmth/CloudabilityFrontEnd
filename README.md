**The task**

Please write, in any language you choose, a small application that retrieves data from the world bank API.

You'll be combining multiple data sets to create a CSV file.

First, you'll get a list of countries that have a "High income" level value (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/898590-country-api-queries) and then get the GPD value for the most recent year (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/898614-api-aggregates-regions-and-income-levels) of those countries.

The CSV should have 4 columns (country name, longitude, latitude and GDP value) with the aggregated data.

Please include any/all details about how to retrieve and run this application (dependencies, versions, etc.)
